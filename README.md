Before you are able to do anything, you must first create an account. In order to create an account, from the landing page, you must click on the button that reads “Create an Account”. Once you do that, you will be redirected to a new page that contains a form you can fill out with the email and password you will be using for your account.

## 2. Login to Account
Once you have created your account, you are able to login to your account. In order to do so, you must first redirect yourself to the login page by clicking on the button that reads “Login”. Once you are at the correct page, you will enter the same email address and password you used to signup with. If you have managed to successfully login, you will be redirected to a new page that asks you enter a “key”.

Once you have registered an account, the admin will have to verify that you are indeed allowed to take the quiz. As soon as this happens, you will receive an email containing the unique key that you must enter to proceed onto the quiz.

## 4. Take the Quiz
Once on the quiz page, the user will have the chance to answer ten multiple choice questions. After the user has answered all of the questions--or as many questions as they could--they can click the submit button to send the results of their quiz to our client via email. If for some reason, the user is unable to complete the quiz within the allotted time or for some reason chooses not to submit the quiz, the quiz will automatically submit itself--again sending the results of the quiz to the client.

Once you have submitted the quiz, or the time runs out and the quiz submits itself, you will be redirected to another page that thanks you for completing the quiz.
